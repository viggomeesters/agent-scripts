# Changelog

## 2025-11-14 — Compact Runner Summaries
- The runner's completion log now defaults to a compact `exit <code> in <time>` format so long commands don't repeat the entire input line.
- Added the `RUNNER_SUMMARY_STYLE` env var with `compact` (default), `minimal`, and `verbose` options so agents can pick how much detail they want without editing the script.

## 2025-11-08 — Sleep Guardrail & Git Shim Refresh
- Runner now rejects any `sleep` argument longer than 30 seconds, mirroring the AGENTS rule and preventing long blocking waits.
- Added `bin/sleep` so plain `sleep` calls automatically route through the runner and inherit the enforcement without extra flags.
- Simplified `bin/git` to delegate directly to the runner + system git, eliminating the bespoke policy checker while keeping consent gates identical.

## 2025-11-08 — Guardrail Sync & Docs Hardening
- Synced guardrail helpers with Sweetistics so downstream repos share the same runner, docs-list helper, and supporting scripts.
- Expanded README guidance around runner usage, portability, and multi-repo sync expectations.
- Added committer lock cleanup, tightened path ignores, and refreshed misc. helper utilities (e.g., `toArray`) to reduce drift across repos.

## 2025-11-08 — Initial Toolkit Import
- Established the repo with the Sweetistics guardrail toolkit (runner, git policy enforcement, docs-list helper, etc.).
- Ported documentation from the main product repo so other projects inherit the identical safety rails and onboarding notes.
